# Daily SQL Learning 🧠📊

This folder contains my **day-by-day SQL problem-solving journey**, focused on building strong fundamentals and advanced analytical thinking using SQL.

Each problem is treated as a **learning unit**, not just a solution:
- Clear problem statement
- Thoughtful SQL logic
- Emphasis on correctness, edge cases, and readability

The goal is to master **SQL patterns used in real interviews and real analytics work**.
